# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## Title: Intelligent Sales and Marketing Agent for Website Design Services

### Overview

This system is a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop (HITL) platform designed to discover potential clients (small businesses with no existing websites), prioritize them based on likelihood to pay, gather context and trends for each, and then autonomously generate and deliver personalized outreach content via email and social media (Instagram, TikTok, Telegram). The system leverages LLM-based agents orchestrated via LangGraph, and integrates human reviews at two checkpoints.
